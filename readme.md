> Remaking the chrome offline dinosaur game

Note that this was previously written with p5.js but has since been refactored into a dependency-free approach. You can still see the old p5.js implementation in [the p5js branch](https://github.com/chrisdothtml/chrome-dino/tree/p5js).

## Run locally (literally)
